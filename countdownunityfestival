eat: Implement conversion-focused landing page for ticket sales

This commit outlines the initiative to develop a dedicated landing page designed to serve as a "basecamp" for driving conversions, primarily focused on directing users to purchase tickets for the Unity Festival.

The main objective of this landing page is to:
- Provide essential festival information in a concise and engaging format.
- Build anticipation and excitement (e.g., through a countdown timer).
- Clearly guide users to the official ticket purchasing platform (Passline URL).
- Optimize the user journey from initial interest to ticket acquisition.

This strategic landing page will be crucial for maximizing ticket sales and providing a clear call to action for potential attendees.
