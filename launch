chore: Celebrate official launch as Community Manager for Unity Festival (02/06/2025)

This commit marks the official commencement of my role as Community Manager for the Unity Festival project, effective June 2nd, 2025.

It signifies the active development and implementation phase of the CM strategy, including:
- Daily social media planning and execution.
- Content creation and scheduling (as outlined in the CM planner).
- Engagement tracking and reporting.
- The ongoing development and optimization of the festival's digital presence,
  including the conversion-focused landing page.

Excited to contribute to the success of "La Uni√≥n de las Tribus"!
